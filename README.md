proverber<br/>
=========<br/>
<br/>
This tool can generate proverbs (or other sentences actually) by picking elements out of a database of words and a database of grammatical/semantical structures (initially based on existing english proverbs, but the words database is now a fairly big English dictionary).<br/>
<br/>
As an example, here is a batch of proverbs with the current database (as of 2015/01/08) :<br/>
